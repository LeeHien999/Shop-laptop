## Instructions for using the email sending function
- To use the function of sending activation email or password to the registered account, you need to have a Gmail account and enable 2-layer security mode to get the key. You can follow the instructions here.
- After having a Gmail account, you need to edit mail-related information in the .env file as follows:
```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME="yourmail@gmail.com"
MAIL_PASSWORD=yourkey
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="yourmail@gmail.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```
- You replace `yourmail@gmail.com` and `yourkey` with your email and key.
